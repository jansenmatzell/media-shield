          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>MediaShield was created to empower individuals with the knowledge and tools needed to recognize, resist, and counter disinformation tactics in the digital age. By applying information theory principles to the challenges of disinformation, we provide a robust framework for understanding how malicious actors manipulate information environments and how we can protect ourselves.</p>

        <div class="approach-section">
          <h2>Our Approach</h2>
          <p>Our approach combines theoretical understanding with practical applications:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Information Theory Framework:</strong> We apply Shannon's information theory principles to analyze disinformation tactics, framing them as manipulations of signal, noise, and channel capacity.</li>
            <li><strong>Research-Based Countermeasures:</strong> Our recommended countermeasures are grounded in cognitive science, media studies, and information security research.</li>
            <li><strong>Accessible Education:</strong> We translate complex concepts into approachable, practical guidance that anyone can apply in their daily digital interactions.</li>
            <li><strong>Interactive Learning:</strong> Our platform emphasizes hands-on learning through simulations, quizzes, and practical exercises that demonstrate key concepts.</li>
          </ul>
